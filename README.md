# Module 3 Final Project

For the Flatiron Data Science course's Module 3 Project, I analyzed a provided subset of the Northwind Database.

This repository contains the dataset itself, a PNG file of the diagram schema of the tables in the dataset, presentation slides and a Jupyter notebook of the analysis.

The PNG schema of the dataset is as follows:
![Diagram of the Northwind dataset's SQL tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bronwencc/Module-3-Project/master/Northwind_ERD.png)

In the main part of the repository:

* [student.ipynb](https://github.com/bronwencc/Module-3-Project/blob/master/student.ipynb) is the Jupyter notebook containing code that tests four hypotheses
* Northwind_small.sqlite is the dataset provided by Flatiron for this analysis
* [Module2-Final-Project.pdf](https://github.com/bronwencc/Module-3-Project/blob/master/Module2-Final-Project.pdf) contains the slide presentation explaining the project and analysis
* CONTRIBUTING contains information for contributing to The Flatiron School's respositories
* LICENSE contains the licensing information for The Flatiron School's materials

In the "files" folder, there are seven .CSV files of data that can be read into the Jupyter notebook to review analysis for each hypothesis without starting from the beginning with the Northwind_small.sqlite file.

In the "graphs" folder, there are five .PNG files with charts comparing differences that were tested in hypotheses.
